        <p>I spent four years studying fine arts at a competitive liberal arts college in Virginia. Lots of long nights in an archive, painting studio, or dark room taught patience and perserverance. Conversations with museum directors, visiting artists, and gallery owners honed concepts and critical thinking.</p>
